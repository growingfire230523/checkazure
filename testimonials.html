              FACC and Azure, both have been a defining part of my life at IITD. Having been dazzled by the amazing artworks during the BRCA orientation in my first year, I've been interested to join the club since the beginning, but I wasn't so confident about it as I didn't think that my artistic skills were at par with the artists here. I was delighted to know that I didn't need to be a good artist before coming here, I just needed to have the zeal and motivation to learn it here to be a part of the club. I was able to explore digital art which was really new to me, and I had amazing seniors like Animesh, Vaibhav, Sonal who helped and guided me throughout. My time preparing for inter IIT Roorkee and my tenure as the FACC secy have been some of my best times here. Even though COVID put a halt to many things which I wanted to do as a secy, I still had a lot of fun.

              Not just have i been a part and arcel of azure over these beautiful years. Azure was integrated to my life in IIT. I remember when I first came across amazing FACC seniors like Animesh and Manav, who told me about Azure, making my very first instinct to be a part of it. IIT life pyaare seniors aur bakchod fachho ke sath kab nikal gayi, pata hi nahi chala. Somani and Rahul made it much easier for me to get through the tough times. Thery were my constant companions♥️.  My fondest memory in IIT was late night inter IIT practices. Unfortunately we couldn't go to inter IIT but  in  even though online Inter IIT, my team showed the same, rather even more enthusiasm and hum first aaye. I am really grateful to my team who supported me in my decisions to bring new reforms and initiatives.

              Imagine creating something that will feature in the pictures of dozens of the IITD junta or something that will catch people's eyes on campus even after decades. This is the feeling that FACC gives you. Be it making wall paintings together in insti, doing charcoal in hostel library, or participating in Inter-IIT, it has been an enriching experience. The most memorable of all being the visit to NGMA! Additionally, being in FACC has groomed my imagination and visualization skills while giving me various fun memories to cherish.

              I too faced the problem to choose a club from the overwhelming amount of options you have at IIT. I tried a few of them, from both cultural and technical areas, before settling down with FACC and I never regretted that. I always had a knack for visual art, and here I got the opportunity to explore this interest more and learn from some of the most amazing people, some professional and others hobbyist like me. I was involved in the FACC events from my first semester, starting with face painting, and then helping manage Rendezvous events and then the next year, becoming hostel representative for the club, participating in all of the all-nighter wall painting events, to practicing daily with friends and having lots of fun in the process. This club has given me a lot, best friends, experience, exhilaration, and a lot of memories to love.

              FACC IITD has been a constant partner in my journey through the 4 years of campus life. What I love about the club is the plethora of opportunities it gave me to work on stuff we never would have imagined in our lives. Add to that the countless memories we made, and you have the most fulfilling college life. I still remember my first external competition with Vaibhav sir, Ekant and Riya and how that one event has been a common occurrence in our happy get together conversations. Ayush and Ekant always made the club a fun place for me and the only thing I wish I could do is bring together my and Ekant's dream child- the design society :P.

              When i first entered this new world of IIT Delhi, i felt lost. Nothing seemed interesting and i just had to wait for Friday to go back home again. I was neither getting any better in academics nor ECAs. One day after few months, i decided to participate in Charcoal Painting, and consequently joined FACC Club. That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. From that day onwards, my life changed completely. FACC taught me perseverance and self expression. It had an open and encouraging environment where i explored my mind, enhanced creativity and cultivated my ability to have different views. The support of seniors, and fellow student community i got was priceless. I truly cannot imagine any other place as progressive, creative and humble at the same time. My academics improved, i gained confidence and started taking part in other sports and cultural activities. I was not the same lost person anymore. Thank you Fine Arts and Crafts Club !

              I still remember painting my way (and my roommate's face!) to being the Best FACC Fresher in first year, to being able to paint the winning Samurai mural with my freshers as the FACC Rep which still wows everyone visiting Satpura to this day. While heading the Creative & Deco team for Rendezvous 19, I got to work with a diligent team and we were able to put up the most extravagant show Rdv has seen in the recent years. In spite of the periodic reality TV worthy FACC poltu drama over the years, I've learnt so much from my talented seniors and made lifelong friendships with my diligent juniors - wonderful people I probably wouldn't have gotten to know so well if it wasn't for FACC. I'll always be grateful to this club for the impact I could create (and leave a souvenir of my time here) in the campus through our team's collaborative projects and the impact this club has made on my fulfilling experience here at IIT!
